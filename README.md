# Picaxe-20X2-prop-controller
This is a prop or robot controller based on the picaxe 20X2 Microcontroller 
I find this system much easier to use then the Arduino. I also have not found anything that the Arduino can do that this controller cannot do. 
The Picaxe get a bad rap for being a quote "less powerful or beginner Micocontroller" when that is simply not the case. 
There is also a Picaxe board that has the Arduino form factor and can use Arduino shields. 
If I need something that the Picaxe cannot handle then I will use the ESP32 controller which can also be programmed in Python.
